aboutme: "I am a PhD student in Bioinformatics at La Trobe University studying the transmission of a parasitic disease called River Blindness. I utilize different computational and mathematical approaches to integrate genomic, environmental and epidemiological data to predict, prevent and eliminate both infectious and non-infectious diseases. I am equally adept at different molecular and laboratory techniques."
